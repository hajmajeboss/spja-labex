6   He was charmed with the quaint and unique Crescent City. It was a
7   totally different world from that in which he had been reared--a summer
8   land, warm, indolent, luxurious, where one plucked the golden oranges
9   from the dark-green boughs, laden at once with flowers and fruit, and
10   where the senses were taken captive by the sensuous perfume of rare
11   flowers that, in his Northern land, grew only within the confines of
12   the close conservatory. Then, too, the dark, handsome faces of the
13   people, and their mixture of foreign tongues, had their own peculiar
14   charm. Nothing amused him so much as a stroll through the antique

23   past in a blaze of splendor never to be forgotten; for it was at the
24   famous Metairie Race-course that he first met Mme. Lorraine.

29   Eliot Van Zandt.
